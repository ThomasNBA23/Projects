# 🤖 Machine Learning Practice Scripts

This repository contains small and self-contained **machine learning scripts** that I use to **practice and learn different ML techniques**.

The goal is to build a solid understanding of:
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Model training and evaluation
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Classical ML algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Visualization of results

Each script focuses on a specific method or concept, such as:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Means Clustering
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- PCA, etc.

> I'm using this repo as a personal learning space to explore different models and improve my ML skills step by step.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 📁 Structure

Each script is organized in its own file or folder, and includes:
- Code to load sample data
- Model training & evaluation
- Comments and explanations

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an evolving project – new scripts will be added as I explore more techniques and datasets.
